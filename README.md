- Creating static visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Interactive visualizations using `plotly` and `dash`
- Data storytelling through visualizations

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Installation

To set up the environment and run the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohamed682004/IBM-Data-Visualization.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd IBM-Data-Visualization
    ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If the `requirements.txt` file is not available, manually install the necessary libraries using `pip install`.)*

## Project Files

The repository contains the following files and folders:

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different data visualization techniques.
- **Data**: Sample datasets used in the visualizations.
- **Images**: Saved visualizations from the assignments.
  
## Usage

You can run the Jupyter notebooks locally to explore the visualizations. To start Jupyter, use the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open the notebook files from the repository to explore or modify the visualizations.
